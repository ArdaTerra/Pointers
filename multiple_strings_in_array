Store multiple strings in an array
Suppose we wanted to store multiple words in an array. Each individual word is typically stored as an array of characters,
so we're going to find ourselves with an array of arrays-- a so-called two dimensional array.

Let me show you in an example. In order to declare a multidimensional array of characters, we would use the data type char.

#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    char words[3][10];
    int i;
    printf("Please enter three words: ");
    for (i=0; i<3; i++) 
    {
        scanf("%s", words[i]);
    }
    printf("You entered: \n");
    for (i=0; i<3; i++) 
    {
        printf("%s ", words[i]);
    }
    printf("\nFirst letters: \n");
    for (i=0; i<3; i++) 
    {
        printf("\"%s\" starts with the letter '%c'.\n", words[i], words[i][0]);
    }
    return 0;
}

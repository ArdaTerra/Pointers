Store strings in arrays using pointers

How to store several words as strings in an array. An array of pointers, to be precise.
Each word will be stored in a null terminated array of characters, as we did before, 
and then we'll create one array that holds the pointers to all of these strings.

#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    char a[4];
    char b[6];
    char c[9];
    char * words[3] = {a, b, c};
    printf("Please enter a word with at  most 3 letters: ");
    scanf("%s", a);
    printf("Please enter a word with at  most 5 letters: ");
    scanf("%s", b);
    printf("Please enter a word with at  most 8 letters: ");
    scanf("%s", c);
    printf("You entered: \n");
    printf("%s %s %s.\n", a, b, c);
    printf("%s %s %s.\n", words[0], words[1], words[2]);
    return 0;
}

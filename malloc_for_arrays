How to allocate space and memory for an entire array using malloc.
The basic idea is to take the size of the data type you wish to store in the array, 
and then multiply it by the number of elements for which you need space.

#include <stdlib.h>
int main(void) 
{
    int * array;
    array = (int *) malloc(5*sizeof(int));
    array[0] = 3;
    array[1] = 44;
    array[2] = 2;
    * (array + 3) = 7;
    * (array + 4) = -1;
    free(array);
    return 0;
}
